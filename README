= acts_as_versioned - Ubilabs Fork

Added restore functionality for deleted versioned model by using a second column 
to reference the versioned model. This column is no real foreign_key and survives 
the destroy of the versioned model.

E.g.:

acts_as_versioned :association_options => {:dependent => :nullify}, :original_id_column=>"original_id"

----

foo.destroy
deleted = Foo.find_latest_versions_of_deleted
foo = restore(deleted.last)

or:

foo.destroy
find_all_versions_by_deleted_id
restore
